## Convert STIX-2.1 to Neo4j csv file format 

This application **StixToNeo4j**, converts [STIX-2.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvqWaPPnPW-2NiVCLqzRszcx91ffMowfT5MmE9Nsy_w/edit#) 
objects and relations from json and zip files into a csv [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/)  representation. 

The [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/) open standard Structured Threat Information Expression [STIX-2.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvqWaPPnPW-2NiVCLqzRszcx91ffMowfT5MmE9Nsy_w/edit#) 
is a language for expressing cyber threat and observable information.

[Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) "is a highly scalable native graph database that leverages data 
relationships as first-class entities, helping enterprises build intelligent applications 
to meet todayâ€™s evolving data challenges."
In essence, a graph database and processing engine that is used here for storing Stix objects 
and their relationships.
 
This application converts [STIX-2.1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yvqWaPPnPW-2NiVCLqzRszcx91ffMowfT5MmE9Nsy_w/edit#) 
domain objects (SDO) and relationships (SRO) to [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) csv format ready for 
bulk import into a Neo4j graph database.

### Dependencies and requirements

Depends on the scala [ScalaStix](https://github.com/workingDog/scalastix) library
(included in the "lib" directory) and the **doimport.sh** script to import the csv files into Neo4j db.

Java 8 is required to run **StixToNeo4j**. 

Neo4j is required to be installed to use the **doimport.sh** script.

### Installation and packaging

The easiest way to compile and package the application from source is to use [SBT](http://www.scala-sbt.org/).
To assemble the application and all its dependencies into a single jar file type:

    sbt assembly

This will produce "stixtoneo4j-1.0.jar" in the "./target/scala-2.12" directory.

For convenience a **"stixtoneo4j-1.0.jar"** file is in the "distrib" directory ready for use.

### Usage

Creating a Neo4j graph database from a file of Stix objects requires two steps.
First convert the Stix objects to Neo4j csv format using **StixToNeo4j**, 
then import those csv files into Neo4j using **doimport.sh** script. 

Converting the Stix objects to Neo4j csv format, simply type at the prompt:
 
    java -jar stixtoneo4j-1.0.jar --csv stix_file.json output_dir
    or
    java -jar stixtoneo4j-1.0.jar --zip stix_file.zip output_dir
 
where "--csv" determines the conversion format, "stix_file.json" is the Stix file containing a 
bundle of Stix objects you want to convert, and "output_dir" is the destination output directory 
with the new format results. If the output directory is absent, the output is directed to the current 
directory.
 
If the input file is a zip file with one or more files containing bundles of Stix objects,
the output file will also be a zip file with results.
 
Once the Neo4j csv files are generated, use the **doimport.sh** script (currently MacOS) to bulk import the files into 
a Neo4j graph database. 
See [Neo4j import-tool](http://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/3.2/tutorial/import-tool/) for how to use and 
customize the import tool for your OS.
 
### Status
